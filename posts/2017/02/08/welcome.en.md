Hello and welcome to my blog! I am Sukil Etxenike, from Navarre, Spain. I study English Studies at the University of the Basque Country (UPV / EHU). 

After more than a year thinking about writing a blog, today I've decided to start with it. In this blog, I will speak mostly about tech and accessibility, in Basque, Spanish and English. I promise I'll write at least once a month.

See you in the next post!
