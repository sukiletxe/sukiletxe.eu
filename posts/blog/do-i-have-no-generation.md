I've been toying with the idea of being a part of the [Indieweb] movement. This movement wants to retain the ownership of the content they produce everywhere, centralicing their identity in their domain. I somewhat agree with this. It's a [fairly complicated thing to do,][kg] and I don't know how I would manage it with [Netlify] and [GitHub.][gitHub] In addition I have some doubts about how would I manage my random replies to tweets, and I've read [a blog post explaining privacy concerns about other people's interactions.][GDPR]

Anyway, I was reading this when I came across [a list of generations in the Wiki][generations] which tries to categorise people based on their knowledge level. And it got me thinking. You see, I am an overlap between generations 1, 2, 3 and 4 (yup, all of them). Let me explain, last first:)

* Generation 4: Depends on what they mean by "Easily turned off by industry jargon like DNS, Hosting, Servers, silos, Domain Registrars." I currently have no idea about how DNS records work, and I confuse self-hosting and hosting (the verbs, I think hosting (noun) is the space you get in a server).
* Generation 3: The hosted part is wrong, I'm using [Nikola] to build this site, I have it in [GitHub][source] and I'm using [Netlify] to deploy it. The rest is correct.
* Generation 2: The first sentence is false, the second one is true.
* Generation 1: I use IRC, and I somewhat understand Git as I use it from the command line. I can read lengthy documentation though I must admit I sometimes try finding the part which interests me instead of reading everything (but I think that's common).

So, what do you think?
