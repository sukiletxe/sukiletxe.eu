Welcome! My name is Sukil Etxenike, and this is my blog, my corner of the Internet. [You can read more about me here.][about]

Here you will find more or less whatever comes to my mind (probably mostly stuff related to computers and accessibility). I intend to write at least once a month. Anyway, enjoy, and [subscribe to the rss feed][rss] and share if you like my content. See you in my next post!
